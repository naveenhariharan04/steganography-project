# Image-Steganography-JS-AES
Image Steganography Project  This web app hides messages in PNGs using LSB steganography and AES encryption. It embeds a secret message into an image's pixels, making the change invisible. A correct key is needed for extraction; an incorrect one shows only encrypted text, ensuring security. Built with HTML, CSS, and JS.
